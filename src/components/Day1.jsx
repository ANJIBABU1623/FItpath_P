                <p1>On the first day, you should take as many fruits as possible. However, including more watermelon and muskmelon is better, as these fruits are fibre-rich. You can also have fruits like oranges, papaya, and apples.

Ensure to drink around 8-12 glasses of water and avoid starving at any point in the day. Whenever you are hungry, grab yourself some fruit. Being fibre-rich and low-fat, fruits satisfy your hunger without increasing calorie intake.</p1>
